# AncientMetagenomeDir - Environmental

![check_dataset](https://github.com/spaam-workshop/AncientMetagenomeDir/workflows/check_dataset/badge.svg)

This page describes columns definitions for the Environmental metagenome list.

This list covers metagenomes like:

- soil
- sediments
- ice cores
- (natural) decomposition environments (e.g. non-host microbial communities of
  skeletal elements)

Numeric fields (e.g. Sample Age), can be filled with `NA` to indicate 'no
reported value'. Text fields (e.g. `geo_loc_name` can be indicated with
`Unknown`).

All column with 'defined categories' should be validated against
`assets/enums/<column>.json`. This is to ensure data consistency, e.g. all Lake
Sediment samples are listed as `lake sediment` (as defined in
`assets/enums/<column>.json`. This is to ensure data consistency.

If you wish to a new category, please consult with the [SPAAM
community](spaam-workshop.github.io), and then add it to
`assets/enums/<column>.json`.

Sample columns are as follows:

## project_name

- Format: surnameYYYY (YYYY in numeric format)
- Due to restrictions in regex (used for validation checks), **characters with
  accents cannot be used**.
  - In these cases use the non-accented version.

> :warning: [MIxS v5](https://gensc.org/mixs/) compliant field

## publication_year

- YYYY format

## publication_doi

- Publication DOI
- Or library permalink
  - e.g. [worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/), [HAL](hal.archives-ouvertes.fr)
    etc.

## site_name

- As reported in publication
- Accents are allowed
- Missing name: `Unknown`

## latitude

- Decimal format
- Maximum three decimals
- In WGS84 projection (coordinates taken from Google Maps is recommended, range
  90 to -90)
- Can be searched in wider literature, rough location is acceptable but use
  fewer decimals
- Missing value: `NA`

## longitude

- Decimal format
- Maximum three decimals
- In WGS84 projection (coordinates taken from Google Maps is recommended, range
  180 to -180)
- Can be searched in wider literature, rough location is acceptable but use
  fewer decimals
- Missing value: `NA`

## geo_loc_name

- Based on modern day definitions
- Must be based on [INDSC Country list](http://www.insdc.org/country.html)
- Missing name: `Unknown`

> :warning: [MIxS v5](https://gensc.org/mixs/) compliant field :warning: Must
> follow categories specified in `assets/enums/<column>.json`

## sample_name

- Unique identifier for that sample as used in publication

## sample_age

- Single date rounded to nearest century (i.e. end in '00')
  - e.g. something only 50 years old would be assigned as 100
- In Before Present (BP) format i.e. since 1950 AD (~2000 AD is also fine)
  - When in doubt:
    [https://nikhausmann.shinyapps.io/BP_to_BC_and_more/](https://nikhausmann.shinyapps.io/BP_to_BC_and_more/)
- Can be obtained from other publications if known (see `sample_age_doi`)
- If date _ranges_ reported, take approximate mid-point
- Dates for specific individual preferred.
- Proxy dates are allowed. e.g.
  - from other individuals in stratum/burial
  - period of occupation of site
  - via coin or historical records
- Radiocarbon dates
  - Uncalibrated dates are preferred, but if only calibrated reported can be
    used
- Missing value: `NA`

## sample_age_doi

- DOI of publication with date derived from
- Can be duplicate of Publication DOI
- Or library permalink
  - e.g. [worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/), [HAL](hal.archives-ouvertes.fr)
    etc.

## material

- Description of sediment following [Environment
  Ontology](http://www.environmentontology.org/Browse-EnvO)
  - e.g. permafrost, lake sediment, peat soil, bone

> :warning: partly [MIxS v5](https://gensc.org/mixs/) compliant field, following
> [Environment Ontology](http://www.environmentontology.org/Browse-EnvO)
> :warning: Must follow categories specified in `assets/enums/<column>.json`

## collection_date

- Year of sample collection in YYYY format
- If sample is from a sediment core, may be later than year of core collection
- Missing value: `NA`

> :warning: [MIxS v5](https://gensc.org/mixs/) compliant field

## archive

- e.g. [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena),
  [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra), [OAGR](https://www.oagr.org/)

> :warning: Must follow categories specified in `assets/enums/<column>.json`

## archive_accession

- Of *sample*, where possible
- For ENA/SRA: These should be **secondary** accession IDs to keep as close to
  data as possible (e.g. SRS, ERS, not SAMEA - see below)
- If non-NCBI/ENA, use as close to sample-level as possible
- Multiple can be separated with commas
  - e.g. when different extracts of one sample incorrectly uploaded as samples
